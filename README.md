# CycleGan

Image-to-Image translation allows us to generate a new image from a given one with specific changes, such as transforming a horse in a zebra and the other way around. This type of training typically requires a large dataset of paired examples.These datasets can be difficult and expensive to prepare, in some cases impossible, such as paintings with landscapes.

CycleGAN is a technique that overcomes this difficulty,models are trained in an unsupervised manner using a collection of images from the source and target domain which do not need to be related in any way. This simple technique is powerful, achieving visually impressive results on a range of application domains.CycleGAN is a technique for training unsupervised image translation models via the GAN architecture using unpaired collections of images from two different domains.CycleGAN has been demonstrated on a range of applications including season translation, object transfiguration, style transfer, and generating photos from paintings.
